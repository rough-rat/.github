# Rough Rat electronics

Hi, we're @cr1tbit and @wilyweasel. We met at [Hackerspace Pomerania](hsp.sh) (@hspsh)

We decided to join our hardware and artistic skills to start this small brand, exploring the unusual trade of PCB art and technology-driven shitposting.

Our creations are mostly open source, we invite everyone to contribute with ideas (and to extend the pilky addon standard when it hopefully soon catches on)

This profile and project repositories are still work in progress.

### Critbit

My $dayjob is C/Linux programming, I also take some commisions for electronics/firmware development.

I love clean schematics, challenging myself to create cheap yet usefull devices and out-of-the-box thinking when solving hardware product challenges.
