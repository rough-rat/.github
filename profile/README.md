# Rough Rat electronics

Hi, we're @cr1tbit and @wilyweasel. We met at [Hackerspace Pomerania](hsp.sh) (@hspsh)

We decided to join our hardware and artistic skills to start this small brand, exploring the unusual trade of PCB art and technology-driven shitposting.

Our creations are mostly open source, we invite everyone to contribute with ideas (and to extend the pilky addon standard when it hopefully soon catches on)

This profile and project repositories are still work in progress.

# FAQ
### Q: what direction should LEDs be soldered in, on the boykisser badge?

A: We forgot to explicitly mark it. They should be soldered upside-down, like this:

### Q: what is the rough manufacturing cost of the cyberbadges? Are they your project?

A: I (critbit) made a horrible mistake, thinking that noone would be interested in buying an 80eur cyberbadge, so I did not bring more of them. Their manufacturing + component cost is somewhere around 65eur, however 7/30 PCs arrived dead due to one ore more of the WS2812 LED not being soldered correctly and/or not working.

For this device to be guaranteed not to bring any loses to us, its' price should be closer to 160eur probably.

The new revision has been split into a dumb frontboard, and an independent brain module (https://github.com/cr1tbit/pilkbrain, not documented as of time I'm writing this). 

The LED matrix with no MCU / battery charger, costs 6usd (4L pcb) + 50usd assembly (@5 units). The schematic is inspired by the cheap HUB75 LED matrices. The price could considerably go down with scale. 

Assembling 256x5 LEDs costs only 7USD. Since the 1515 RGB LED is so cheap, 1/3 of that price comes from the flat per-component fee.

The brain module costs around 100usd/5pcs, but it's very much in development stage. It could be replaced by a much cheaper solution for sure.

### Critbit

My $dayjob is C/Linux programming, I also take some commisions for electronics/firmware development.

I love clean schematics, challenging myself to create cheap yet usefull devices and out-of-the-box thinking when solving hardware product challenges.
